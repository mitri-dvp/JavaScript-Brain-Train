## JavaScript Brain Train!  
This is a fun little game, inspired by Brain Age.   
The objective of this game is to write the **correct answer** to the displayed **Math Question**.     
### Features!   
  - Four different Game Modes.  
    - **Easy**: Only **Adition** and **Subtraction** question with **One** digit numbers will be displayed.   
    - **Medium**: All of the **Arithmetic Operations** questions with **One** digit numbers will be displayed.  
    - **Hard**: Same rules as **Medium** but the correct answer does not have a range limit (even negative numbers can be the answer).  
    - **🔥Imposible🔥**: Same rules as **Hard** but with **Two** digit number questions.  
  - Time limit of **30s**. 

This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**.
